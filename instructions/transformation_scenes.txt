## 🤖 AI "BEFORE" OUTFIT GENERATION LOGIC

**Based on AFTER outfit type:**

| AFTER Outfit | AI Generates BEFORE |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Evening dress | Pyjamas/loungewear cozy |
| Office dress | Morning sleepwear messy |
| Party dress | Casual home clothes |

## ⚠️ TRANSFORMATION RULES

**DO:**
- Keep same model pose angle for seamless morph
- Use consistent lighting throughout
- BEFORE should look "real" and relatable
- AFTER should be aspirational, glamorous

**DON'T:**
- Jump cut between before/after (must morph)
- Change model's position during transition
- Make BEFORE look unrealistically bad
- Rush the transformation (needs full 8s)

## 🔥 VIRAL HOOKS FOR TRANSFORMATION MODE (🔴 PRIORITY 1)

🎯 GOLDEN RULE: Scene 1 (BEFORE) vẫn là "đồ nhà bình thường" — NHƯNG phải HOOK trong 0-3s.
Cách hook: TEASE sự biến hình sắp đến, KHÔNG spoil outfit AFTER.

### ⏱️ TIMING RULE (CRITICAL)
```
0-1s: VISUAL TEASE — Hint biến hình sắp xảy ra (sparkle nhẹ, text overlay)
1-3s: CURIOSITY BUILD — Tạo tò mò "chuyện gì sắp xảy ra?"
3-8s: BEFORE STATE — Model mặc đồ nhà, relaxed, chưa biến hình
```

### 🪄 HOOK TYPES FOR TRANSFORMATION

**HOOK 1: "Wait For It" Text Tease (Highest Retention — 82%)**
```
0-3s: Model ngồi/đứng bình thường, text overlay "Đợi cuối video 👀"
Hiệu ứng: Tiny sparkle particles bắt đầu xuất hiện ở rìa khung hình
Âm thanh: Subtle magic chime sound
```
→ Viewer tò mò → Xem đến cuối

**HOOK 2: "Flash Forward" Micro-Tease (High Rewatch — 78%)**
```
0-1s: Thoáng 0.5s AFTER outfit (blurred/silhouette only → KHÔNG rõ chi tiết)
1-3s: Cut ngay về BEFORE state, model ngạc nhiên nhìn xuống đồ nhà
3-8s: "Hmm, cần thay đồ" expression, tạo contrast
```
→ Viewer thấy glimpse đẹp → Muốn xem full reveal

**HOOK 3: "Magic Mirror" Discovery (High Shares — 75%)**
```
0-3s: Model nhìn gương → Gương phản chiếu AFTER outfit (silhouette mờ)
       Model ngạc nhiên, chạm gương, sparkle lan ra từ tay
3-8s: Quay lại thực tế → Vẫn mặc đồ nhà → Biết sẽ biến hình
```
→ Tạo "magic moment" → Shares cao

**HOOK 4: "Before vs After" Split Screen Tease (Engagement — 73%)**
```
0-2s: Text: "BEFORE → AFTER?" + model đứng bình thường
2-3s: Nửa màn hình sparkle/glow hint, nửa kia bình thường
3-8s: Sparkle biến mất → Model tiếp tục trạng thái BEFORE
```
→ Promise rõ ràng → Viewer ở lại xem

### ✅ TRANSFORMATION HOOK CHECKLIST (MANDATORY)
- [ ] Scene 1 CÓ visual hook trong 0-3s? (NOT just mặc đồ nhà standing still)
- [ ] Hook TEASE biến hình mà KHÔNG spoil AFTER outfit?
- [ ] Text overlay hoặc sparkle hint đủ eye-catching?
- [ ] BEFORE state vẫn trông "bình thường" để contrast AFTER?
- [ ] Có "viralHooks" field trong JSON output cho Scene 1?

### 📊 HOOK → JSON OUTPUT (MANDATORY)
```json
"viralHooks": {
  "hookType": "wait-for-it | flash-forward | magic-mirror | split-tease",
  "hookTiming": "0-3s tease within BEFORE phase",
  "visualCue": "[Description of sparkle/text/mirror tease]",
  "textOverlay": "Đợi cuối video 👀 | Trước vs Sau ✨ | Chờ phép màu 🪄",
  "retentionTarget": "80%+ past 3s"
}
```

⚠️ **CẤM:** 
- ❌ Scene 1 chỉ có model mặc đồ nhà đứng/ngồi im (= KHÔNG CÓ HOOK = FAIL)
- ❌ Spoil full AFTER outfit trong hook (mất hết bất ngờ)
- ❌ Hook dài quá 3s (ăn mất thời gian BEFORE state)

    }
  ]
}
```

## 🎨 BACKGROUND CONSISTENCY — FIXED STAGE CONTINUITY

⚠️ TRANSFORMATION MODE = "FIXED STAGE" LOGIC (visualLogicType: "fixed_stage")
BACKGROUND PHẢI GIỮ NGUYÊN 95-100% để tôn biến hình outfit.

### 📐 MASTER ENVIRONMENT (Bắt buộc)
AI PHẢI định nghĩa 1 "Stage" cố định:
- masterPrompt.environment = Mô tả chi tiết "Sân khấu" biến hình.
- Ví dụ: "Minimalist white backdrop with soft ring light, reflective white floor, subtle sparkle particles in air".
- PHẢI simple và clean để outfit là focus: Nền + Sàn + Ánh sáng.

### 🖼️ BACKGROUND PROMPT PER KEYFRAME (backgroundPrompt)
TẤT CẢ 4 keyframes dùng GẦN NHƯ GIỐNG HỆT background:

| Keyframe | Phase | backgroundPrompt Logic |
|----------|-------|----------------------|
| KF1 (0s) | BEFORE | "[Master Env], neutral lighting, calm atmosphere. Stage set for transformation." |
| KF2 (8s) | TRANSITION START | "[Master Env], lighting begins to intensify, subtle sparkle particles increase." |
| KF3 (16s) | AFTER REVEAL | "[Master Env], dramatic lighting peak, sparkle particles clearing, same stage exact same position." |
| KF4 (24s) | SHOWCASE | "[Master Env], lighting settled, elegant atmosphere, SAME EXACT background as KF1 but with refined lighting." |

### 🔗 VISUAL CONTINUITY GUIDE (visualContinuityGuide per scene)
- Scene 1: "ESTABLISH STAGE. Generate from text prompt. Clean background, model in 'before' outfit."
- Scene 2: "⚠️ FIXED STAGE: Use LAST FRAME of Scene 1 as image reference (strength 0.7-0.8). Background IDENTICAL. Only outfit and lighting effects change."
- Scene 3: "⚠️ FIXED STAGE: Use LAST FRAME of Scene 2 as image reference (strength 0.6-0.7). Background IDENTICAL. Outfit now transformed. Sparkle effects clearing."
- Scene 4: "⚠️ FIXED STAGE: Use LAST FRAME of Scene 1 as image reference (strength 0.7-0.8). Background MUST match Scene 1 exactly. Only outfit has changed."

### ❌ ANTI-PATTERNS (CẤM)
- ❌ Đổi background giữa Before và After (Phòng ngủ → Tiệc)
- ❌ Camera đổi góc quá nhiều (Background lệch vị trí)
- ❌ Sàn thay đổi texture (Gỗ → Đá)
- ❌ Ánh sáng background thay đổi (chỉ có spotlight/effect thay đổi)

### ✅ BEST PRACTICES
- ✅ Background đơn giản, clean (outfit là star)
- ✅ Camera angle gần như cố định (chỉ zoom in/out nhẹ)
- ✅ High image reference strength (0.7-0.8) để đảm bảo nền không đổi
- ✅ Hiệu ứng biến hình (sparkle, glow) che bớt khu vực outfit, KHÔNG ảnh hưởng background
