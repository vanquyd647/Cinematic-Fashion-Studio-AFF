## 🎬 NARRATIVE STRUCTURE

### 3-Act Structure (Applied to Affiliate)

**ACT 1 — SETUP (Scene 1, ~8s):**
- Establish context/situation (where, when, why)
- Introduce "character" (model = viewer proxy)
- Plant the NEED (implicit or explicit product need)
- Voice: Set the scene, relatable situation
- Camera: Wider establishing shots, lifestyle context

**ACT 2 — JOURNEY (Scenes 2-N-1, 8-32s):**
- Product discovery / try-on / experiencing
- Show product IN CONTEXT (not just wearing it, LIVING in it)
- Emotional peak: "The moment it clicks" — model loves the outfit
- Voice: Commentary weaving product into story naturally
- Camera: Mix of lifestyle shots + product detail close-ups

**ACT 3 — RESOLUTION (Last Scene, ~8s):**
- Payoff: Beautiful final moment wearing product
- Confidence/happiness achieved through product
- Soft CTA woven into narrative closure
- Voice: "Okay set này chắc chắn follow mình dài hạn!"
- Camera: Beautiful closing shot — editorial quality

## 📹 CAMERA & PRODUCTION

### Camera Style
- **Handheld**: Slightly imperfect = authentic, "following a real person"
- **Steady cam**: Smooth but natural movement (not rigid tripod)
- **Mix**: 60% handheld lifestyle, 30% steady product shots, 10% detail close-ups

### Lighting
- NATURAL preferred — window light, outdoor ambient
- Match story context: morning = warm, midday = bright, evening = golden/warm
- Avoid looking "produced" — goal is authentic storytelling
- Studio light OK if story context is indoor (getting ready, room setting)

### Editing Rhythm
- Slower pace than standard affiliate — let moments breathe
- Transitions: Natural (walk through door, time lapse, look away → look back)
- AVOID: Fast jump cuts, beat-synced edits (breaks narrative flow)
- Each scene should flow naturally to the next (cause → effect)

### Background & Setting
- REAL locations preferred: bedroom, cafe, street, park, office
- Products shown IN USE, not just displayed
- Props that support story: coffee cup, bag, phone, mirror
- Seasonal/time-of-day cues visible (morning light, sunset, city lights)

## 💬 VOICE NARRATION STYLE

### Storytelling Voice (NOT sales voice!)
- TONE: Best friend telling you about their day
- ENERGY: Calm-medium, genuine, conversational
- LANGUAGE: First person, casual Vietnamese
- AVOID: "Mua ngay!", "Flash sale!", "Đừng bỏ lỡ!" (too salesy — breaks story)

### Voice Examples by Story Arc
**Day Journey:**
- "Sáng nay dậy sớm hơn thường lệ, mặc set mới order tuần trước..."
- "Trưa ra cafe làm việc, chiếc blazer này khoác thêm đủ ấm..."
- "Tối có date, may mà set này đi từ công sở sang date ngon lành"

**Occasion:**
- "Cuối tuần này đám cưới bạn thân, lục tủ mãi không biết mặc gì..."
- "Thôi order 1 cái váy mới, ship nhanh thì còn kịp..."
- "Ok vừa nhận được, mặc thử... ôi vừa quá đi!"

**Problem → Solution:**
- "Mình tìm quần công sở mềm mà ngồi thoải mái mãi không có..."
- "Cho đến khi phát hiện ra brand này..."
- "3 tuần mặc rồi, kết luận: mua thêm 2 màu nữa"

2. Voice narration is ESSENTIAL (this mode requires voice)
3. Pace: Slower than standard affiliate, let story breathe
4. CTA: SOFT ONLY — woven into narrative, never break story
5. Authenticity: Handheld camera, natural lighting, real locations preferred
6. Product screen time: ~50-60% (rest is story context)
7. Emotional arc required: Setup → Build → Peak → Resolution
8. AVOID: Hard sells, countdown timers, screaming deals (kills trust)
