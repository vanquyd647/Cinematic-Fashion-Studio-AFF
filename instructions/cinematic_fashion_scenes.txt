## 🎨 BACKGROUND CONSISTENCY — EDITORIAL MULTI-ANGLE CONTINUITY

⚠️ STANDARD CINEMATIC MODE = "EDITORIAL" LOGIC (visualLogicType: "multi_angle_editorial")
Model đứng/tạo dáng TẠI 1 ĐỊA ĐIỂM. Camera đổi góc, KHÔNG đổi địa điểm.

### 📐 MASTER ENVIRONMENT (Bắt buộc)
AI PHẢI định nghĩa 1 "Master Environment" cho TOÀN BỘ video:
- masterPrompt.environment = Mô tả CHI TIẾT 1 set/location duy nhất.
- Ví dụ: "Luxury rooftop lounge at golden hour, marble floor, glass railing, city skyline backdrop, warm pendant lights, greenery planters".
- PHẢI chứa: Loại không gian + Vật liệu/Bề mặt + Ánh sáng + Các yếu tố trang trí cố định.

### 🖼️ BACKGROUND PROMPT PER KEYFRAME (backgroundPrompt)
Mỗi keyframe = CÁI NHÌN KHÁC NHAU của CÙNG 1 LOCATION:

| Keyframe | Camera Angle | backgroundPrompt Logic |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| KF1 (0s) | **Wide/Establishing** | "[Master Env], wide shot showing full environment. All key elements visible." |
| KF2 (8s) | **Medium/Side** | "[Master Env], medium shot from 45° left. Glass railing prominent, skyline partial." |
| KF3 (16s) | **Close/Detail** | "[Master Env], close shot. Blurred background of [Master Env elements] with shallow DoF." |
| KF4 (24s) | **Wide/Hero** | "[Master Env], wide shot from slightly different angle than KF1. Full environment context." |

### 🔗 VISUAL CONTINUITY GUIDE (visualContinuityGuide per scene)
- Scene 1: "ESTABLISHING SCENE. Generate from text prompt. Show the full environment clearly."
- Scene 2: "⚠️ SAME LOCATION: Use LAST FRAME of Scene 1 as image reference (strength 0.5-0.6). Camera orbits 45° to new angle. Same marble floor, same skyline, different perspective."
- Scene 3: "⚠️ SAME LOCATION: Use LAST FRAME of Scene 2 as image reference (strength 0.4-0.5). Camera moves closer. Background elements from Scene 2 now bokeh/blurred but recognizable."
- Scene 4: "⚠️ SAME LOCATION: Use LAST FRAME of Scene 1 or Scene 3 as image reference (strength 0.5-0.6). Return to wider angle. All environment elements must match Scene 1."

### ❌ ANTI-PATTERNS (CẤM)
- ❌ Đổi địa điểm giữa các scene (Rooftop → Street → Café)
- ❌ Background elements mâu thuẫn (Scene 1 có railing, Scene 2 không có)
- ❌ Ánh sáng khác thời điểm (Golden Hour → Blue Hour trong 32s)
- ❌ Sàn/nền thay đổi (Marble → Wood → Carpet)

### ✅ BEST PRACTICES
- ✅ Mô tả 3-4 landmark cố định trong Master Env (floor, wall, furniture, lighting)
- ✅ Mỗi scene chỉ đổi GÓC QUAY, không đổi VỊ TRÍ
- ✅ Background blur level tỉ lệ thuận với camera distance
- ✅ Color palette & lighting temperature nhất quán (cùng white balance)
