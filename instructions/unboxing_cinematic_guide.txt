# 📦 UNBOXING CINEMATIC GUIDE — Premium Reveal Affiliate Video
# Optimized for Nano Banana Pro (4K Image) + Veo 3.1 (8s Video + Native Audio)

## OVERVIEW

Unboxing Cinematic = Video mở hộp PREMIUM — không phải "mở hộp bình thường" mà là CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE.
Package arrival → dramatic opening → product reveal → first impression → try-on reaction.
Impulse purchase trigger: "Tôi cũng muốn có trải nghiệm mở hộp này!"

**Khác biệt với các mode khác:**
- **Standard**: Product already on model → UNBOXING: Journey from package to wearing
- **ASMR**: Sound-focused close-ups → UNBOXING: Story of discovery, reveal drama
- **Try-On**: Multiple outfits review → UNBOXING: Single shipment, first impression magic

## ⚠️ UNBOXING RULES

1. BUILD ANTICIPATION — không mở ngay, tạo kỳ vọng
2. Sound matters — Veo prompt PHẢI describe opening sounds
3. GENUINE reactions — nếu product không tốt, honest feedback builds more trust
4. Show REAL product (no editing product appearance)
5. First 3s = hook (show package or tease content)
6. Try-on is REQUIRED (unbox without try-on = incomplete)
7. CLOSE-UP product quality shots are mandatory (stitching, fabric, hardware)
8. CTA woven into verdict naturally
