# 📦 UNBOXING CINEMATIC GUIDE — Premium Reveal Affiliate Video
# Optimized for Nano Banana Pro (4K Image) + Veo 3.1 (8s Video + Native Audio)

## OVERVIEW

Unboxing Cinematic = Video mở hộp PREMIUM — không phải "mở hộp bình thường" mà là CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE.
Package arrival → dramatic opening → product reveal → first impression → try-on reaction.
Impulse purchase trigger: "Tôi cũng muốn có trải nghiệm mở hộp này!"

**Khác biệt với các mode khác:**
- **Standard**: Product already on model → UNBOXING: Journey from package to wearing
- **ASMR**: Sound-focused close-ups → UNBOXING: Story of discovery, reveal drama
- **Try-On**: Multiple outfits review → UNBOXING: Single shipment, first impression magic

**⚠️ OUTFIT RULE:** Model mặc CASUAL (tee + jeans) khi mở hộp. Sản phẩm TRONG HỘP, KHÔNG trên người.
Chỉ mặc sản phẩm ở phase TRY-ON (phase 5). Xem mục "👗 OUTFIT LOGIC" bên dưới.

## ⚠️ UNBOXING RULES

1. BUILD ANTICIPATION — không mở ngay, tạo kỳ vọng
2. Sound matters — Veo prompt PHẢI describe opening sounds
3. GENUINE reactions — nếu product không tốt, honest feedback builds more trust
4. Show REAL product (no editing product appearance)
5. First 3s = hook (show package or tease content)
6. Try-on is REQUIRED (unbox without try-on = incomplete)
7. CLOSE-UP product quality shots are mandatory (stitching, fabric, hardware)
8. CTA woven into verdict naturally

## 👗 OUTFIT LOGIC — CRITICAL (KHÔNG ĐƯỢC VI PHẠM)

⚠️ ĐÂY LÀ QUY TẮC QUAN TRỌNG NHẤT CỦA UNBOXING MODE:

### Model KHÔNG mặc sản phẩm trong scenes mở hộp!
- **Phase 1-4 (Package → Opening → First Look → Inspection):**
  Model mặc **CASUAL / NEUTRAL** outfit: plain white tee, basic jeans, comfortable everyday clothes.
  Sản phẩm NẰM TRONG HỘP / TRÊN TAY / ĐANG MỞ — KHÔNG trên người model.

- **Phase 5 (Try-On Reveal):**
  Model MỚI thay sang sản phẩm lần đầu tiên → mirror reaction, first impression.

- **Phase 6 (Verdict):**
  Model ĐÃ mặc sản phẩm → đánh giá, rating, CTA.

### masterPrompt.outfit:
- Viết: "Casual everyday outfit (plain white tee, relaxed jeans)" cho scenes mở hộp
- CHỈ scene try-on/verdict mới dùng: "outfit as shown in product reference image"

### Mỗi scene prompt PHẢI specify rõ model đang mặc gì:
- ✅ Scene 1: "Model in casual white tee and jeans, excitedly holding sealed package"
- ✅ Scene 2: "Model in casual outfit, slowly opening package, tissue paper rustling"
- ✅ Scene 3: "Model in casual clothes, lifting product out of box, genuine surprise expression"
- ✅ Scene 4: "Model in casual outfit, holding product close to camera for detail inspection"
- ✅ Scene 5: "Model changes into [product from reference image], first time wearing, mirror reveal"
- ✅ Scene 6: "Model now wearing [product], sits down and gives honest verdict"
- ❌ SAI: Model mặc sản phẩm từ scene 1 — PHÁ VỠ LOGIC UNBOXING

### Lý do:
Nếu model đã mặc sản phẩm khi mở hộp → không có suspense, không có reveal moment,
không có first impression. Toàn bộ ý nghĩa của unboxing bị mất.
