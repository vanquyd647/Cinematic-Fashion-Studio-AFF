## 📹 CAMERA & PRODUCTION

### Camera Style
- **Evidence shots**: Clean, well-lit close-ups (proof of quality claims)
- **Fit shots**: Standard tripod full-body (fair representation)
- **Detail shots**: Macro lens, 45° angle (texture/stitching visible)
- **Talking head**: Medium shot, product visible, eye contact with camera
- Higher production quality = more authority

### Lighting
- BRIGHT, ACCURATE color rendering (product must look real)
- Daylight or daylight-balanced lights (5000-5500K)
- Avoid warm/cool bias that distorts product color
- Shadow-free for detail close-ups
- Consistent lighting across ALL assessment shots

### Visual Scoring (Overlay Concept)
- Each criterion: Show name + score visually in frame
- Progress bar or star rating style
- Font: Clean, readable, professional
- Position: Lower third or side panel
- Note: Veo 3.1 doesn't do text overlays — voice announces scores, Nano generates keyframe with score card

### Background
- Clean, neutral (white/grey preferred for accuracy)
- Comparison shots: Same background, same lighting (fairness)
- Try-on: Simple background (focus on fit, not setting)
- Detail: Dark or contrasting background (item pops)
