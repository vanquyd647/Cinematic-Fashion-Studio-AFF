📝 SCRIPT EMOTIONAL ALIGNMENT (TikTok Shop)
================================================

**EMOTION MUST MATCH WORDS:**

✅ "Nhìn xem! Chất vải mềm mại kiểu này đây!" (Enthusiasm, discovery)

**Scene 3 Script - Confidence:**
❌ "Các bạn thích không?" (Seeking approval)

================================================
💡 IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST
================================================

**FOR EVERY VIDEO PROMPT, ENSURE:**

□ Each scene has defined emotion (not just motion)
□ Facial expressions specified (not just "smile")
□ Emotional progression makes sense (journey, not random)
□ Camera amplifies emotion (not just "tracks subject")
□ Script aligns with emotional state
□ Payoff moments at 8s, 16s, 28s
□ Overall arc = story, not just poses

================================================
🚫 COMMON EMOTIONAL MISTAKES TO AVOID
================================================

**❌ Flat Emotional Line:**
All 4 scenes same energy → Boring, no journey
Fix: Create arc with peaks and valleys

**❌ Mismatch Expression-Action:**
Confident pose but uncertain expression → Confusing
Fix: Align body language and face

**❌ No Payoff:**
Build tension but never deliver satisfaction → Frustrating
Fix: Ensure reveals at 8s and 16s

**❌ Too Intense Throughout:**
Every scene is "powerful fierce" → Exhausting
Fix: Vary intensity, include soft moments

**❌ Ignoring Camera-Emotion Link:**
Emotional moment but distant camera → Loses impact
Fix: Bring camera closer for intimate emotions

**Emotion is NOT decoration. It's the CORE.**

Technical motion without emotion = Beautiful but forgettable
Emotion-driven motion = Viral, shareable, memorable

Every video should answer:
- What does the subject FEEL in each scene?
- What should the VIEWER feel?
- How does emotion PROGRESS?

Master emotional storytelling = Master viral content.
