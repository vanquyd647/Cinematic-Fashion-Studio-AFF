# 🎤 ASMR CINEMATIC GUIDE — Sound-Driven Affiliate Video
# Optimized for Nano Banana Pro (4K Image) + Veo 3.1 (8s Video + Native Audio)

## OVERVIEW

ASMR Cinematic = Video bán hàng tập trung vào ÂM THANH + CẬN CẢNH.
Fabric rustling, zipper sounds, nails tapping, package crinkling → trigger thính giác → HIGH watch time → HIGH conversion.

**Khác biệt với các mode khác:**
- **Standard**: Visual-first, cinematic camera → ASMR: Audio-first, macro close-ups, sound triggers
- **Try-On**: Full body outfit showcase → ASMR: Extreme close-up textures, sounds of wearing
- **Unboxing**: Package → reveal story → ASMR: Sound of EVERY step is the star

- Draping: Vải rơi, treo → "fabric cascading, soft landing sounds"
- Buttons: Cài nút → "button clicking sounds, one by one"
- Zipper: Kéo khóa → "zipper sliding sound, slow and satisfying"
- Velcro: Dán velcro → "velcro peeling sound"
- Snap: Bấm nút bấm → "snap button clicking"

## 📹 CAMERA & PRODUCTION

### Lens & Framing
- **PRIMARY**: Macro lens equivalent — EXTREME close-up (fabric weave visible)
- **SECONDARY**: Medium close-up — hands interacting with product
- **TERTIARY**: Medium shot — product in context (occasional, brief)
- Most shots: 70% macro/extreme close-up, 20% medium close-up, 10% medium/full

### Lighting
- Soft, warm directional light (side/back lighting creates texture depth)
- NO harsh overhead (kills texture detail)
- Rim light on fabric edges (enhances tactile feel)
- Background: Dark or neutral blur (attention on product)

### Camera Movement
- STATIC or very slow push-in (stability = quality feel)
- Slow orbit around product detail
- Focus pulls: macro detail → slightly wider (reveal product)
- NO fast movement, NO quick cuts (ASMR = slow, deliberate)

### Audio (Veo 3.1 Native)
- ⚠️ CRITICAL: Audio is the PRIMARY content, NOT secondary
- NO background music in ASMR scenes (music kills ASMR effect)
- Voice: Whisper or soft-spoken ONLY (if any voice)
- Ambient: Minimal room tone (quiet environment)
- Veo 3.1 prompt MUST include sound descriptors: "sounds of fabric rustling", "audible zipper", etc.

## ⚠️ ASMR RULES

1. SOUND IS KING — mọi shot phải có sound purpose
2. 70%+ shots must be macro/extreme close-up
3. NO background music (kills ASMR effect) — chỉ ambient sound
4. Movements: SLOW, DELIBERATE, CONTROLLED
5. Voice (nếu có): Whisper only
6. Editing: Longer takes (3-5s per shot minimum), NO rapid cuts
7. Lighting: Soft, directional, warm — emphasize texture
8. AVOID: Fast motion, loud sounds, busy backgrounds, text overlays
